# A cross-bridge cycling model for understanding the role of metabolite accumulation in skeletal muscle fatigue 
# Abstract
Skeletal muscle fatigue is associated with the accumulation of metabolites, i.e., adenosine diphosphate (ADP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and protons (H+), which are thought to inhibit muscle force- and motion-generating capacity during intense exercise. However, the mechanisms of inhibition are controversial and therefore not completely understood. Here, we developed a mathematical model of cross-bridge cycling that accounts for the biochemical kinetic rates and mechanical events to understand the mechanisms of metabolite-mediated inhibition of force. We parameterized the model based on experimental data collected from five sedentary to recreationally active young adults performing a dynamic (0.75 Hz) plantar flexion exercise to exhaustion (642Â±104 s), including in vivo concentrations of metabolites and H+ measured by 31P Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy as well as muscle activation signals obtained via electromyography (EMG). Using EMG signals as input, our model accurately simulated the observed changes in metabolite levels (SSR=5.1). Our model simulations suggested that to produce the force needed for a sustained plantar flexion exercise, muscles progressively recruit more motor units. In the absence of this progressive muscle recruitment, we observed a reduction in force-generating capacity due to inhibition by metabolic products. Our simulations also showed that Pi reduced force production by 30% when we increased it 50% above the end-exercise concentrations measured experimentally. Elevations in ADP and H+ had an insignificant effect on force in the model. A parameter sensitivity analysis suggested that force is strongly dependent on the rate of Pi release, whereas an increase in Pi accelerated rebinding to actomyosin and prevented the formation of a strongly bound actin-myosin complex, resulting in decreased force production during muscle fatigue.
